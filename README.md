# Android IMSI-Catcher Detector Lite (AIMSICDL)

**Note:** *AIMSICDL is a reboot of the [original AIMSICD project](https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/) but focusing on a core, simple set of features that actually work. [See this issue](https://github.com/CellularPrivacy/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/926) for the rationale behind the movement.*

AIMSCIDL detects [IMSI-Catchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI-catcher). IMSI-Catchers are false mobile towers (base stations) acting between the target mobile phone(s) and the real towers of service providers. As such they are considered a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack. In the USA the IMSI-Catcher technology is known under the name "[StingRay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stingray_phone_tracker)". Find out more in our [WIKI](https://github.com/5GSD/AIMSICDL/wiki).

The app aims to provide two main features with respect to IMSI-Catchers:

* Primarily offer live & active detection of IMSI-Catchers being deployed nearby
* Secondarily collect data for later analysis and inspection

### What it does

AIMSICDL attempts to detect IMSI-Catchers through  such as these:

### Why use it

The FBI or local police regularly deploys IMSI-Catchers hidden in vehicles at protests to obtain a record of everyone who attended with a cell phone (leave your phones at home by all means if you really have to attend). IMSI-Catchers also allow adversaries to intercept your conversations, text messages, and data. Police can use them to determine your location or to find out who is in a given geographic area at what time. Identity thieves can use freely [available tools](http://www.nsaplayset.org/) to monitor and manipulate communications from a parked car in your residential neighborhood; notably for stealing passwords or credit card data from people nearby who make purchases on their phones.

The reason IMSI-Catchers are so commonly used is that it is very easy to get away with using them traceless. This app aims to make it possible to detect the IMSI-Catchers so that using them becomes a risky proposition. It also aims to make users safer by alerting on possible interception and tracking.
